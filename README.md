THIS COMES UNDER WEB DEV - I 
This is the assignment 01 of web dev where i have used HTML to Create a basic portfolio of myself.
I have used multiple tags like, <head>, <title>, <nav>, <ul>, <img>, <label> etc. and ids are alloted to each section for easy navigation.
Used very basic CSS to make the profile photo circular in shape, <style> tag is used.
